# Track and Follow Functionality Fixes

## Race Conditions and Timing Issues

- [x] **Eliminate Delayed Follow After Track**
  - Replace setTimeout with proper async/await to ensure track completes before follow
  - Ensure commands are processed in the correct sequence

- [ ] **Fix Async State Updates**
  - Add error handling for failed backend operations
  - Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback capability
  - Ensure frontend state is consistent with backend state

- [ ] **Fix Circular Dependency in useEffect**
  - Remove the dependency on `followedCharacter` in the useEffect that updates it
  - Separate tracking and following state update logic

## Backend Logic Issues

- [] **Improve Unfollow Side Effects**
  - When untracking a followed character, ensure a clear state transition
  - Consider maintaining the followed state even when untracking

- [ ] **Add Transaction Support for Multiple Operations**
  - Wrap related database operations in transactions
  - Ensure atomicity when unfollowing one character and following another

- [ ] **Improve State Propagation**
  - Add version or timestamp to state updates
  - Ensure frontend can identify and process the most recent state
  - Discard outdated updates if a newer one has been processed

## UI and Error Handling Improvements

- [ ] **Enhance Error Handling**
  - Add more robust error handling in both frontend and backend
  - Provide clear feedback to users when operations fail
  - Log detailed error information for debugging

- [ ] **Improve UI Feedback**
  - Add loading indicators during async operations
  - Provide clear visual feedback for follow/unfollow actions
  - Handle edge cases gracefully in the UI

## Testing and Validation

- [ ] **Add Comprehensive Testing**
  - Test rapid follow/unfollow sequences
  - Test concurrent operations from multiple users
  - Test error recovery scenarios

- [ ] **Add Monitoring**
  - Add telemetry to track follow/unfollow operations
  - Monitor for unexpected state transitions
  - Set up alerts for potential issues
