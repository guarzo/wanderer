# Project Overview

## Purpose
This project uses Cursor AI to assist with development tasks while following strict guidelines for code quality and safety. The main goal is to create a mapping application for the game EVE Online.

## Key Principles
- AI-First Development
- Type Safety
- Comprehensive Documentation
- Systematic Approach to Tasks

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** React and LiveView
- **Backend:** Elixir/Phoenix
- **State Management:** 
  - Frontend: Custom state management solution based on React hooks
  - Backend: PostgreSQL for persistence

## Technology Stack
- React
- Elixir/Phoenix
- PostgreSQL
- React-flow (for system mapping)
- LiveView

## Development Guidelines
- All code changes must maintain type safety
- Documentation is required for new features
- Error handling must be comprehensive
- Follow MECE principle for task breakdown

## Key Features
- User authentication
- Track users as they navigate
- Mapping of systems using react-flow
- Tracking of user activities
- Tracking of system signatures

## Development Process
